                    Third-party companies provide third-party advertisements on
                    our websites and other such websites where we advertise.
                    These third-party companies use the information of user
                    visits to our website. Whenever these advertisements are
                    displayed to the user, the third-party companies place their
                    unique cookies on the user’s browser. Through these cookies,
                    ads are displayed whenever users visit the site. Also, the
                    website may utilize web beacons that are offered by
                    third-party advertising companies for the supervising online
                    advertisements. Using web beacons, the website can recognize
                    the cookies as and when the user visits the website. The web
                    beacons also allow the site to recognize banner ads that
                    directed the user to the website. Web Beacons: These are
                    programming code used for the display of an image on a web
                    page. Web beacons are utilized to transfer the unique user
                    identification of the user to a database. This unique user
                    identification is usually in the form of a cookie, which is
                    utilized to link the individual user to the acquired
                    information in the database. Web beacons help in the
                    tracking of individual online visits to the website. Such
                    tracking enables the regulation of services and products
                    that a user may be interested in. Also, this allows the
                    tracking of online behavioral patterns of users for
                    marketing purposes. Cookies: These are small data parts
                    created by a web server. Cookies are distributed through a
                    web browser and stored on the user’s computer. These help in
                    the tracking of the online patterns and preferences of the
                    user. Additionally, cookies help to identify the user as a
                    return visitor. These also create customization of a user’s
                    web experiences so the user does not need to add every
                    information, every time they visit the website. The users
                    visiting the website have to accept the cookies whenever
                    they visit the site to get access to all the features. IP
                    Address: The website gathers the user’s IP address to
                    ascertain problems with our server and manage issues. IP is
                    the number assigned to a user’s computer whenever they use
                    the Internet. IP address is required to recognize a user
                    during any online session. Also, it is used for the
                    collection of data based on demographics. Usage Tracking and
                    Log Files: The website tracks associated information of all
                    the web pages viewed by visitors. Also, the website tracks
                    all the information related to every hyperlink clicked by
                    the user as and when they visit any of our websites or while
                    viewing our emails. Log files are utilized for tracking and
